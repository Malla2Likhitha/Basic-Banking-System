## My process

I first added all the html elements in index.html and then started styling it with css from top to bottom. I didn't go to the styling of next section until I'm satisfied with the one I was doing. Then I added behaviour to my website using basic JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Basic JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to minimize the code but get the desired outcome by doing such challenges.

### Continued development

I want to focus on responsive designing for the next few days to learn more on resizing things according to the device width or browser. I aslo want to explore different Bootstrap modules available.
